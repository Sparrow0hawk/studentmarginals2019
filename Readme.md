# Find my nearest Scottish Marginal

This is a branch of mynearestleedsmarginal2019 that aims to direct volunteers to marginal constituencies in Scotland for the 2019 General Election.

The app will behave expecting a postcode input that matches to nearest marginal constituency. This will provide a link that directs to a google doc containing updated campaigning information.
